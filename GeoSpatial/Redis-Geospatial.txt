Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. 
This will help you to find the distance between the two places by giving the co-ordinates of both.

commands :-

. GEOADD adds a location to a given geospatial index (note that longitude comes before latitude with this command).
. GEOSEARCH returns locations with a given radius or a bounding box.
