Set is a unique type of Data Structure that doesn't allow the duplicate values in the data set.

A Redis set is an unordered collection of unique strings (members). You can use Redis sets to efficiently:
. Track unique items (e.g., track all unique IP addresses accessing a given blog post).
. Represent relations (e.g., the set of all users with a given role).
